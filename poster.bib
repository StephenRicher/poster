abstract = {Despite an abundance of new studies about topologically associating domains (TADs), the role of genetic information in TAD formation is still not fully understood. Here we use our software, HiCExplorer (hicexplorer.readthedocs.io) to annotate {\textgreater}2800 high-resolution (570 bp) TAD boundaries in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify eight DNA motifs enriched at boundaries, including a motif bound by the M1BP protein, and two new boundary motifs. In contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is only enriched on a small fraction of boundaries flanking inactive chromatin while most active boundaries contain the motifs bound by the M1BP or Beaf-32 proteins. We demonstrate that boundaries can be accurately predicted using only the motif sequences at open chromatin sites. We propose that DNA sequence guides the genome architecture by allocation of boundary proteins in the genome. Finally, we present an interactive online database to access and explore the spatial organization of fly, mouse and human genomes, available at

abstract = {The spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus has been implicated in many aspects of regulated gene expression. Maps of high frequency interactions between different segments of chromatin have revealed Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), within which most of the regulatory interactions are thought to occur. Recent studies have shown that TADs are not homogeneous structural units, but rather they appear to be organized into a hierarchy. However, precise identification of hierarchical TAD structures remains a challenge. We present OnTAD, an Optimized Nested TAD caller from Hi-C data, to identify hierarchical TADs. Compared to existing methods, OnTAD has significantly improved accuracy and running speed. Results from OnTAD reveal new biological insights on the role of different TAD levels, boundary usage in gene regulation, the loop extrusion model, and compartmental domains. The software and documentation for OnTAD are available at: {\textless}https://github.com/anlin00007/OnTAD{\textgreater}},
